# Simrail Trains Timetable

## Note: this is still under development

## What it does

Goal is to provide drivers their timetable, stops, and eventually speed limits, kilometric points, and maybe even autoscroll/arrow to point at next waypoint.

## How is it done

This app is written in Python 3 + Flask

All this is achieved thanks to DKFN's API and EDR work. Many thanks to him.

## How to deploy

Coming later, still not ready to do that.
